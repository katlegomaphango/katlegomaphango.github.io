                                Hi there! I'm Katlego, an Aspiring Junior Developer. I'm passionate about
                                turning ideas into reality through code. I've always been interested in 
                                computers and gadgets, and as I delved deeper into programming, I 
                                discovered my love for problem-solving and creating innovative solutions. 
                                I'm currently learning C# and JavaScript

                                determination to grow as a developer. Outside of coding, I enjoy outdoor 
                                activities like hiking and sports, believing a balanced life enhances 
                                creativity and problem-solving.
